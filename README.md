## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating the Healthy Wealthy app stemmed from the frustration of waiting in clinics for extended periods to access health professionals and the high costs associated with their services. Recognizing the importance of prioritizing health and not ignoring any health concerns, the need for a solution became evident. The app aims to address these challenges and be a go-to resource for mental health support, healthy eating guidance, exercise advice, and instant access to medical perspectives. By harnessing the power of AI, the app empowers individuals to take charge of their health anywhere, anytime, making health truly wealth.

Healthy Wealthy is an AI-powered app utilizing Computer Vision (CV) and Language Model (LLM) to empower users with health and wellness insights. It detects health issues in X-ray scans, guides healthy eating, plans diets, suggests wholesome shopping options, provides emotion-based mental health support, acts as an AI exercise coach, tracks exercise moves, corrects pose estimation, checks for proper gestures, generates summaries of medical reports, and much more.

## How we built it?
This project uses AI, CV, LLM and Streamlit 
Streamlit - it is used to build the web app.
CV = it is used for image processing
llm = it is used to chat with patients, provide aditional info, give summary and a lot more.

## Challenges we ran into
It was challenging to integrate computer vision with llm. Since I am in my initial stage of learning streamlit , making the project was challenging. To build an app for patients in an interactive manner was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Detect the diseases by processing the xray scans
- provide nutritional guidance to patients
